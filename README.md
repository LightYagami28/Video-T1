Video-T1: We present the generative effects and performance improvements of video generation under test-time scaling (TTS)
settings. The videos generated with TTS are of higher quality and more consistent with the prompt than those generated without TTS.

</div>

## ðŸ“¢ News

- `2025.3.24` ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— We release *Video-T1: Test-time Scaling for Video Generation*

## ðŸŽ‰ Results

![Results Visualization](assets/results-teaser.png)

</div>

Results of Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation. As the number of samples in the search space increases by scaling test-time
computation (TTS), the modelsâ€™ performance exhibits consistent improvement.


## ðŸŒŸ Pipeline

![Pipeline Visualization](assets/pipeline.png)

</div>

Pipeline of Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation. Top: Random Linear Search for TTS video generation is to randomly
sample Gaussian noises, prompt the video generator to generate sequential of video clips through step-by-step denoising in a linear manner,
and select the highest score form the test verifiers. Bottom: Tree of Frames (ToF) Search for TTS video generation is to divide the video
generation process into three stages: (a) the first stage performs image-level alignment that influences the later frames; (b) the second stage
is to apply dynamic prompt in test verifiers V to focus on motion stability, physical plausibility to provide feedback that guides heuristic
searching process; (c) the last stage assesses the overall quality of the video and select the video with highest alignment with text prompts.



## ðŸ”§ Installation

### Dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/liuff19/Video-T1.git
cd VideoT1
conda create -n videot1 python==3.10
conda activate videot1
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT && cd LLaVA-NeXT && pip install --no-deps -e ".[train]"
```

### Model Checkpoints:
You need to download the following models:
 - **Pyramid-Flow** model checkpoint (for video generation)
 - **VisionReward-Video** model checkpoint (for video reward guidance)
 - (Optional) **Image-CoT-Generation** model checkpoint (for ImageCoT)
 - (Optional) **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (Or other LLMs)** model checkpoint (for hierarchical prompts)

## ðŸ’» Inference

### 1. Quick start

```bash
cd VideoT1
# Modify videot1.py to assign checkpoints correctly.
python -m videot1.py --prompt "A cat wearing sunglasses and working as a lifeguard at a pool." --video_name cat_lifeguard
```

### 2.Inference Code

For inference, please refer to **videot1.py** for usage.

```python
# Import Pipeline and Base Model
from pyramid_flow.pyramid_dit import PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration
from pipeline.videot1_pipeline import VideoT1Generator

# Initialize Pyramid-Flow Model
pyramid_model = init_pyramid_model(model_path, device, model_variant)

# Initialize VisionReward Model
reward_model, tokenizer = init_vr_model(vr_path, device)

# Initialize VideoT1 Generator
generator = VideoT1Generator(
    pyramid_model,
    device,
    dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    image_selector_path=imgcot_path,
    result_path=result_path,
    lm_path=lm_path,
)

# Courtesy of Pyramid-Flow
# Use the generator to generate videos using TTS strategy
best_video = generator.videot1_gen(
    prompt=prompt,
    num_inference_steps=[20, 20, 20],      # Inference steps for image branch at each level
    video_num_inference_steps=[20, 20, 20], # Inference steps for video branch at each level
    height=height,
    width=width,
    num_frames=temp,
    guidance_scale=7.0,           
    video_guidance_scale=5.0,      
    save_memory=True,             
    inference_multigpu=True,      
    video_branching_factors=video_branch,
    image_branching_factors=img_branch,
    reward_stages=reward_stages,
    hierarchical_prompts=True,     
    result_path=result_path,
    intermediate_path=intermed_path,
    video_name=video_name,
    **reward_params                
)

```

### 3.Multi-GPU Inference

Save GPU Memory by loading different models on different GPUs to avoid OOM problem. 

Example: Load **Reward Model** in GPU0, **Pyramid-Flow** in GPU1 and **Image-CoT** model in GPU2

```bash
# Load Models in different GPUs
python videot1_multigpu.py --prompt "A cat wearing sunglasses and working as a lifeguard at a pool." --video_name cat_lifeguard --reward_device_id 0 --base_device_id 1 --imgcot_device_id 2 --lm_device_id 3
```

Please refer to videot1_multigpu.py for multi-GPU inference.

### 4.Usage Tips

1. **reward_stages**: Choose three indices for reward model pruning. If tree's depth is in three indices, all video clips would be fed into reward models for judging.

2. **variant**: We recommend 768p for better quality, choose from 384,768 (same as Pyramid-Flow)

3. **img_branch**: A list of integers, each correspond to the number of images at the beginning of ImageCoT process at this depth.

4. **video_branch**: A list of integers, each correspond to the number of generated next frames at this depth.  
*Namely, if img_branch is array* $A[]$, *video_branch is array* $B[]$, *then at depth* $i$, *we would have* $A[i] \times B[i]$ *initial images for each branch, and* $B[i]$ *next latent frames would be the children for each branch.*


## ðŸš€ TODO

We would release Dataset for Test-Time Scaling in CogVideoX-5B
